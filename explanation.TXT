So far in this documents, I've done a few things. The first was add two snakes, which will be representatives of the United States political parties, or presidential candidates. The second thing is the podiums which they are speaking at. The third is the studio backdrop. For the studio backdrop, I have a seperate image that is just the light on the left, which I am overlaying on top of the podium to properly account for depth. There are a couple of ways I want to expand upon this idea. 

One of them is to add a lot of negative/empty space on the left side of the image, which communicates the lack of proper political representation from the left in United States politics. Another thing I was thinking of adding would be text that the snakes are saying, in which the snake on the left says effectively the same thing as the snake on the right, but using a higher degree of euphemism. For example, the snake on the right might be saying to bomb foreign countries, whereas the snake on the left would say something about spreading democracy. The podiums also look odd right now, so I was thinking of adding some sort of box, maybe draped with a United States flag, to cover the part of the image where the podiums cut off. I could also have the two snakes be physically connected somehow, as two heads of the same snake. I also want to give the left snake a blue tie, and the right snake a red tie, to further solidify their political representations. I was also thinking about adding the border of a television screen to the outside of the image, so as to invite viewers to "see past the production/veneer" of political performativity. Another idea I had was to add a boot above the heads of the snakes, to represent the working class's ability to stomp out this kind of corruption. My final idea was to have some sort of "puppet master" controlling the snakes, maybe an oil baron or some other corrupt wealthy individual, to show how politics in the United States is a game of power played by the wealthy elites.
